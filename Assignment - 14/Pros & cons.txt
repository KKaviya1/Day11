ADVANTAGES OF BUBBLE SORT:

Simplicity: 
The Bubble Sort algorithm is straightforward to understand and implement. 
The code provided for Bubble Sort is clear and concise, making it easy to grasp for beginners.

Adaptive:
Bubble Sort is adaptive, meaning it performs well on partially sorted arrays. 
If the input data is nearly sorted, Bubble Sort's time complexity can be close to O(n) since it only requires one pass without any swaps.

In-place sorting:
Bubble Sort requires only a constant amount of additional memory, making it an in-place sorting algorithm.
It does not require any auxiliary data structures, which is beneficial for scenarios with limited memory resources.

DISADVANTAGES OF BUBBLE SORT:

Time Complexity: 
Bubble Sort has a worst-case and average-case time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large datasets. 
It involves multiple passes over the array, even if it is already sorted.

Lack of efficiency: Bubble Sort is generally slower compared to more advanced sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort, especially for large datasets. 
Its slow nature becomes apparent as the size of the array increases.

ADVANTAGES OF INSERTION SORT:

Efficient for small datasets: 
Insertion Sort performs well on small datasets and can outperform more complex algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort when the array is relatively small.

Adaptive:
Like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort is adaptive, meaning it becomes faster when the data is partially sorted. 
It requires fewer comparisons and swaps in such cases.

Online algorithm: 
Insertion Sort can efficiently handle data as it comes, making it suitable for scenarios where new elements are continuously added to an already sorted list.

DISADVANTAGES OF INSERTION SORT:

Time Complexity: 
While Insertion Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n^2), just like Bubble Sort, it may have a better performance due to fewer comparisons and swaps. 
However, it is still not as efficient as advanced sorting algorithms.

Lack of scalability: 
Similar to Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort becomes significantly slower as the size of the array increases. 
It is not suitable for sorting large datasets efficiently.

CONCLUSION:
In the context of this specific program and the given array sizes, both Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort may show similar performance characteristics. 
They both have their advantages and disadvantages, but Bubble Sort may perform slightly better on nearly sorted arrays due to its adaptive nature. 
However, for larger datasets, both algorithms will be slow, and it would be more beneficial to consider other more efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
